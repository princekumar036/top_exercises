            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Place 3-4 hamburger buns in a food processor. Add the dried spices and blend into a breadcrumb mixture. Pour it out into a large bowl.</p>

            <p>Pulse the shrimp in the food processor until they're broken into small pieces. Add the shrimp to the bowl with the breadcrumbs, pour in the lemon zest and hot sauce, crack in an egg, and mix it all together.</p>

            <p>Form golf ball-sized amounts of the mixture into patties, and lay them out on parchment paper or wax paper on a sheet pan. This should make 8 patties. Once they're all formed, put them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes.</p>

            <p>Heat some vegetable oil in a non-stick pan. Cook the chilled patties in the oil, flipping after about 3-4 minutes. Dress the finished patties with the toppings of your choice.</p>
