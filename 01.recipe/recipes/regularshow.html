            <p>Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the melted butter and buttermilk together, then add the egg. Combine the flour mixture with the buttermilk mixture and whisk until they're combined and free of lumps.</p>

            <p>Melt some additional butter on a large skillet, and add bacon strips with space between each. Pour the batter down each bacon strip until it is covered. Make sure to leave space between each cake!</p>

            <p>Cook until the batter bubbles, then flip. Serve the pancakes drizzled with maple syrup.</p>
